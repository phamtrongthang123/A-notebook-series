## Study
- CEVAE: https://bookdown.org/phamtrongthang123/notebookCEVAE/

## Expand Plan 

### 1st phase (small amount of notes): 

```
## Categories
### Child cate... (year, ...)
- notebook of paper
```

### 2nd phase

Each categories is a file (Category.md), inside it listing Child cate and notebooks

### 3rd phase

Each categories is a folder, each subcate is a file, contain notebooks.

And so on ...

**Each notebook will be store in its own repo, to utilize the storage usage below maximum threshold**
